In the stillness of the night, under the moonâ€™s soft glow, there is a sense of mystery and silence. The world around seems to hold its breath as stars punctuate the dark sky. A whisper of the wind rustles through leaves, hinting at secrets kept hidden from the light of day. The night is a canvas, with the vastness of the universe unfolding above, a place of both dreams and fear, a time for quiet contemplation.
